				<h2>Hello! I'm Kayla,</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>Thank you for being here! I’m a born and raised Milwaukee native, and Latina woman that loves to
					travel, create clay jewelry and ceramics, and snuggle with my two bulldogs at home. In my life I’ve
					taught biology abroad, studied public service in graduate school, and worked in nonprofits across
					Milwaukee. However, all of these experiences led me to pursue my dream to be of service to my
					community through liberating movement. In January of 2022, I received my 200hr yoga teacher training
					certification, and my dreams became a reality.
				</p>
				<p>I <i>practice</i> yoga to feel strong, grounded, and confident in my own body. My yoga practice
					brings together my breath, body, mind, the light and dark, the good and the bad. It brings me back
					to myself when my anxieties and intensity of life tilts me off balance, and reminds me of the
					unwavering joy within me.</p>
				<p>I now <i>teach</i> yoga to share with others all that yoga has brought me-life, healing, laughter,
					contentment, confidence. All of the gifts and “aha” moments I’ve received from my 7 years of
					practice is what I am eager to offer students of all levels, shapes, and life experiences. I teach
					yoga to deepen my own practice, and guide others in finding the greatest teacher within themselves.

				<h2>Resilient Joy is committed to</h2>
				<hr />
				<h4>Dignity</h4>
				<p>We value bodily autonomy and the ability for all individuals to feel empowered and in control of
					their body and mind. Resilient Joy welcomes all ages, abilities, and identities into our work, and
					will always meet you where you are at in your journey. We will work one on one to meet your goals,
					and provide you with tools to restore balance, overcome obstacles, and embrace joy.</p>

				<h4>Joy</h4>
				<p>To feel light and filled with elation, pleasure, bliss, and happiness for simply existing in your
					body right now, is to feel joy. To embody a joy that is resilient means that these feelings are
					unwavering within the core of you, no matter the obstacles or life challenges that arise. At
					Resilient Joy, we value and provide tools to cultivate every individual’s human right to embody
					joy–a feeling that has been historically unlearned, shamed, and dismissed in women and BIPOC (Black,
					Indiginous, and People of Color) of all identities.
				</p>

				<h4>Liberating Movement</h4>
				<p>We guide others with an approach that is trauma-informed, in order to restore and maintain balance
					both mentally and physically with breath and gentle movement for people of all levels and abilities.
					Liberating movement is motion and energy flow connected with the breath, paired with practices
					rooted from ancient yogic postures and meditative breath work. With practice, liberating movement
					leads us to a state of being free from mental barriers and limitations, and physical tension and
					constriction. Liberating movement allows us to protect our energy and joy, making it resilient and
					unwavering no matter the obstacles we face.

				<h2>Commonly Asked Questions</h2>
				<div class="items style2 big">
					<section>
						<h3>Is yoga for everyone?</h3>
						<p>Yes! As long as you can breathe, yoga is for you. Yoga can be incredibly calming, healing,
							and strengthening for the body and mind for people of all ages, shapes, identities,
							abilities, backgrounds, and fitness levels. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What should i bring to a session?</h3>
						<p>Nothing, or all of the things! Before starting a session, Kayla will work with you to
							determine what type of movement fits your needs. Items for sessions could include
							comfortable clothes to move in, a yoga mat or towel, chairs, pillows, and sometimes yoga
							blocks (or stack of books). All you need is yourself and something to sit upon. Everything
							else is secondary. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Where do resilient joy sessions take place?</h3>
						<p>Wherever it is comfortable for you! This can include Kayla's yoga space in her home, your
							home, the outdoors, or any other mutually decided upon place.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>How do i pay for sessions?</h3>
						<p>We accept online or cash/check payments. Payment will be discussed prior to sessions.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What type of yoga does resilient joy offer?</h3>
						<p>We offer whatever type of yoga and meditation styles that your body craves. We will work
							together prior to a session to determine what your goals are. Types of sessions that Kayla
							has offered in the past include:
						</p>
						<p>Power &#x2022; Vinyasa &#x2022; Gentle &#x2022; Yin &#x2022; Nidra &#x2022; Chair/Wheelchair
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>What are the benefits of a private yoga session?</h3>
						<p>Private yoga sessions allow for a tailored experience to your (or the group’s) needs and
							goals when it comes to your physical, mental, and spiritual health. Kayla will work with you
							prior to the scheduled session to get a better understanding of what you are looking for,
							and go from there!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>How is yoga different than stretching, or other kinds of fitness?
						</h3>
						<p>Yoga is an ancient eastern practice tracing back to India over 5,000 years ago, that unifies
							the body with breath and movement. Yoga can be used as a physical and spiritual practice,
							while stretching is used to lengthen muscles, sometimes in preparation for more rigorous
							fitness such as running or other sports. Yoga practice can be a great way to heal from
							physical injury, emotional trauma/distress, decrease anxiety, and restore mental, physical,
							and spiritual balance–goals that may be very different from stretching or other kinds of
							fitness. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What are the benefits of community yoga sessions?</h3>
						<p>In sessions you can expect to gently challenge your body. We will practice finding peace and
							joy in challenging moments in session, so that we can find lightness and gratitude in
							challenges outside of session. Kayla’s sessions are open to all levels, are curated through
							a lens that is trauma-aware, and incorporates music that encourages you to move your body,
							focus inward, have fun and flow if that’s what you need! Bring your open heart and mind, and
							trust her to guide you through the rest.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="last-faq">
						<h3>Before You Begin</h3>
						<p>Resilient Joy recommends that you consult your physician regarding the applicability of any
							recommendations and follow all safety instructions before beginning any physical movement
							program. When participating in any exercise or exercise program, there is the possibility of
							physical injury. If you engage in this exercise or exercise program, you agree that you do
							so at your own risk, are voluntarily participating in these activities, assume all risk of
							injury to yourself.</p>
