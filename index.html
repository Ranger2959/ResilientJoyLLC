				<h2>Hello! I'm Kayla,</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>Thank you for being here! I’m a born and raised Milwaukee native, and Latina woman that loves to
					travel, create art, enjoy coffee, and snuggle with my two bulldogs at home. In my life I’ve been a
					biology teacher abroad and worked in the nonprofit sector across Milwaukee in search of my passion
					and purpose–my Dharma. No matter what field I pursued, I knew that at the root of it all, my Dharma
					and dream is to build meaningful relationships, and provide space for joy and healing in this life.
					All of my experiences led me to dedicate my life to service for the community by sharing the gift of
					liberating movement and meditation through the paths of yoga. I set on to make my dreams a reality
					by receiving my first RYT-200 certification to teach yoga in 2021, and continued on to study
					Intuitive Wisdom and Holistic Psychology, earning my RYT-500 certification in 2023.</p>
				<p>I <i>practice</i> yoga to feel grounded, strong, and confident in my own body. My yoga practice
					brings together my breath, body, mind, and spirit. It brings me back to myself when my anxieties and
					intensity of life tilts me off balance, and reminds me of the unwavering joy within me. My yoga
					practice allows me to create space for love and joy to thrive, and thus, healing to begin.</p>
				<p>I now <i>teach</i> yoga to share with others all that yoga has brought me-life, healing, laughter,
					contentment, joy, confidence. All of the gifts and breakthrough moments I’ve received from my many
					years of practice is what I am eager to offer students of all levels, shapes, and life experiences.
					I teach yoga to deepen my own practice, and guide others in finding the greatest teacher within
					themselves.

				<h2>Resilient Joy is committed to</h2>
				<hr />
				<h4>Dignity</h4>
				<p>We value bodily autonomy and the ability for all individuals to feel empowered and intune with their
					body and mind. Resilient Joy welcomes all ages, abilities, and identities into our spaces, and will
					always meet you where you are in your healing and wellness journey. We will work one on one to meet
					your goals, and provide you with tools to create space within to restore balance, overcome
					obstacles, and discover and embody joy.</p>

				<h4>Joy</h4>
				<p>To feel light and filled with elation, pleasure, bliss, and happiness for simply existing in your
					body right now, is to feel joy. To embody a joy that is resilient means that these feelings are
					unwavering within the core of you, no matter the obstacles or life challenges that arise. At
					Resilient Joy, we value and provide tools to cultivate every individual’s human right to embody
					joy–a feeling that has been historically unlearned, shamed, dismissed, and put as secondary in women
					and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) of all identities.
				</p>

				<h4>Liberating Movement</h4>
				<p>We guide others with an approach that is trauma-informed and aware. With the eight-limbs of yoga at
					the center, we strive to restore and maintain balance both mentally, physically, and spiritually
					with breath practices and gentle movement for people of all levels and abilities. Liberating
					movement is motion and energy flow connected with the breath to cultivate strength and emotional
					release. Liberating movement informed holistically by the eight-limbs of ancient yogic practices,
					allows us to feel unified in mind, body and spirit, and to protect our energy and joy, ultimately
					making it resilient and unwavering no matter the obstacles we face.

				<h2>Commonly Asked Questions</h2>
				<div class="items style2 big">
					<section>
						<h3>I want to try yoga with Resilient Joy. Now what?</h3>
						<p>Amazing! Book a brief 15 minute consultation with me <a href="calendar">here</a> to discuss
							what you’re looking for and what may be the best fit for you. If you're interested in events
							or classes open to the community, check out the <a href="events">practice with me</a> page! </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Is yoga for everyone?</h3>
						<p>Yes! As long as you can breathe, yoga is for you. Yoga can be incredibly calming, healing,
							and strengthening for the body and mind for people of all ages, shapes, identities,
							abilities, backgrounds, and fitness levels. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What should I bring to a session?</h3>
						<p>Nothing, or all of the things! Before starting a session, Kayla will work with you to
							determine what type of movement fits your needs. Items for sessions could include
							comfortable clothes to move in, a yoga mat or towel, chairs, pillows, and sometimes yoga
							blocks (or stack of books). All you need is yourself and something to sit upon. Everything
							else is secondary. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Where do resilient joy sessions take place?</h3>
						<p>Individual/small group sessions will take place at <a href="https://madrewellness.com/">Madre
								Wellness</a>, or another provided location based on group size, or wherever is
							comfortable for you! This can include your home, the outdoors, or any other mutually decided
							upon place.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>How do I pay for sessions?</h3>
						<p>After your consultation, once you have decided the package that works for you, Kayla will
							send you an invoice that can be paid in full or split payments. Most payment methods are
							accepted and will be discussed prior to your session during your brief consultation.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What type of yoga does Resilient Joy offer?</h3>
						<p>We offer whatever type of yoga and meditation styles that your body craves. We will work
							together prior to a session to determine what your goals are. The types of sessions that
							Kayla has offered in the past include:
						</p>
						<p>Power Yoga &#x2022; Vinyasa &#x2022; Gentle Yoga &#x2022; Yin &#x2022; Yoga Nidra &#x2022;
							Chair/Wheelchair Yoga
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>What are the benefits of a private yoga session?</h3>
						<p>The large yoga studio setting is not for everyone, and that is ok! Private yoga sessions
							allow for a tailored experience to your (or the group’s) needs and goals when it comes to
							your physical, mental, and spiritual health. It limits distraction from things around you,
							and gives you the tools specified to your needs in order to turn inward and work towards
							your goals. Kayla will work with you prior to the scheduled session in a brief consultation
							to get a better understanding of what you are looking for, and go from there!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>How is yoga different from stretching, or other kinds of fitness?
						</h3>
						<p>Yoga is an ancient eastern practice tracing back to India over thousands of years that unifies the body, mind and breath. Yoga can be used as a physical and spiritual practice, while stretching is used to lengthen muscles, sometimes in preparation for more rigorous fitness such as running or other sports. Yoga practice can be a great way to heal from physical injury, emotional trauma/distress, decrease anxiety, and restore mental, physical, and spiritual balance–goals that may be very different from stretching or other kinds of fitness.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What are the benefits of community yoga sessions?</h3>
						<p>Community sessions are tailored to a larger group’s needs at a workplace, retreat, or other
							types of gatherings. No matter why the group gathered–for fun, centered on a theme of music
							or intention, or to find a pause in a busy day–you can expect that these sessions will
							gently bring together movement and breath for all identities and abilities. We will practice
							finding peace and joy in sometimes challenging moments so that we can find lightness and
							gratitude in challenges outside of session. Kayla’s sessions are open to all levels, are
							curated through a lens that is trauma-aware, and incorporates music that encourages you to
							move your body, focus inward, have fun, and flow if that’s what you need! Bring your open
							heart and mind, and trust her to guide you through the rest.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="last-faq">
						<h3>Before You Begin</h3>
						<p>Resilient Joy recommends that you consult your physician regarding the applicability of any
							recommendations and follow all safety instructions before beginning any physical movement
							program. When participating in any exercise or exercise program, there is the possibility of
							physical injury. If you engage in this exercise or exercise program, you agree that you do
							so at your own risk, are voluntarily participating in these activities, assume all risk of
							injury to yourself.</p>
